                <p>I have a strange view of bestiality/zoophilia. I believe that for some people, it spawns out of depression and anger, but for others, I find it does genuinely come naturally. I don't view bestiality as immoral nor moral. I am incredibly
                    neutral on the subject.<br><br>I see why the idea is disturbing to most people, but at the very same time, I can't understand why some people find enjoy when they watch porn of men and women being pissed on.<br><br>Regardless, it is
                    your right to enjoy what you enjoy. Just do it in the privacy of your own home, and do it safely.<br><br>With animals, all I ask is for the love of god, don't break any limbs, do not impregnate, and please, do not abuse the animal
                    severely during the "training" process as some may call it. I do not condone the action of having sex with animals; I abhor the abuse of animals.</p>

His will, his pleasure, his desire, his life, his work, his sexuality the touchstone, the command, my pivot. I don’t mind working, holding my ground intellectually, artistically; but as a woman, oh, God, as a woman I want to be dominated. I don’t mind being told to stand on my own feet, not to cling, be all that I am capable of doing, but I am going to be pursued, fucked, possessed by the will of a male at his time, his bidding.”
